# VIDEO TRANCRIPTION AND SUMMARISATION 

Develop a ML model(which can be deployed by anyone present in the webinar the whole time) which recognizes the speech of the host throughout the webinar and provides a summary of the entire webinar at the end. This summary generated by our ML model can then be provided to those who missed the meeting by any chance. Scope of this can also be expanded to generating a summary of professor's lectures which student most of the times might miss.

-- Transcription + summary

-- Include recording the session, making the transcript and summarizing imp parts, clip those sections in the video and make a highlight video
